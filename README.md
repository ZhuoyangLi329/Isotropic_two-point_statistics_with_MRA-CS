# Isotropic two-point statistics with MRA-CS

- #### To see a description of this work, please download "mracs_doc.pdf".
- #### If you want to see how the sigma of a cylinder is calculated, please enter the folder 'calculate sigma of cylinder shell'. The theoretical calculation program is written in Python, while the MRA-CS calculation program is written in C++
- #### If you want to know how 2D-2PCF, cylindrical correlation function, and disk correlation function are calculated, please enter the "correlation functions" folder. The theoretical calculation program is written in Python, and the MRA-CS calculation program is written in C++. After entering the 'mcmc' folder, you can also see how we perform parameter estimation.
